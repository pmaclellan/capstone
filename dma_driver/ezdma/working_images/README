This directory contains the required files for booting the first working ezdma
driver implementation:

boot.bin:
	- This file contains the HW image generate from the loopback example in
	the following repo: https://github.com/jeremytrimble/ezdma.
	- The FSBL was automatically created from Vivado SDK. 
	- The uBoot image was generated using the following guide (which 
	contains links to download relevant files): https://homepages.laas.fr/cfoucher/drupal/sites/homepages.laas.fr.cfoucher/files/u93/Installing_Embedded_Linux_on_ZedBoard_v1_0.pdf
	
devicetree.dtb:
	- The device tree was generated according to the guide we used to
	generate uBoot. We did, however modify the pl.dtsi file to match the
	uImage and our custom driver (ezdma).

pl.dtsi:
	- The part of the device tree that we modified to implement the ezdma
	driver. This is known to be working using kernel version 4.0.

uImage:
	- The kernel image version 4.0 with some modifications. We got this
	from the following repo: https://github.com/jeremytrimble/linux-xlnx
